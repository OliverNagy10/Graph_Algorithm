# Graph_Algorithm
This assignment was part of Data Structures and Algoritms module.
The goal was to demonstrate your knowledge of algorithms and data structures that were thought during the module.
After having osm.graph and osm.xyz files in your directory & after compilation of streets.cc with the help of Makefile
You can run the program with ./streets and feed input to it via the input files which specify which query you want 
e.g  ./streets.cc < cs-stan.1.in
